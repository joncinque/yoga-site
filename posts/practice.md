The Importance of a Dedicated Practice
======================================

Consistent practice is the most crucial component of being a yogi, no matter what type you are, 
whether you practice Ashtanga or Rocket, Yin and / or Yang, Bikram or 
non-denominational Hot, Raja
or Bhakti, Laughter or Silent, Lululemon or Naked, Goat or Horse.  
(Side note: the jury's still out on Beer Yoga.  Getting buzzed during practice 
could be hazardous.  Stretching and alcohol do not interact well (TODO link), 
and I can't imagine that beer still tasting good 55 minutes later.)
It isn't always clear what constitutes practice, especially for some of the
less traditional forms of yoga.  This post aims to clear up the first question
surrounding practice: what is it?

What is practice?
-----------------
Practice is often meant to be repetitive and potentially tedious
work undertaken to acheive a goal.  Those goals could be to de-stress, lose
weight, recover from an physical injury, alleviate an emotional burden, etc.
From this sense, yoga looks like any other physical practice, and
you have "grit n' grind," "push through," "tough it out," "put in 110%,"
all to achieve a result.  This definition can be useful for temporary motivation
with short-term goals, but may not serve in the long run.

What is practice about once you're content physically and emotionally?  Sure,
maintenance is necessary.  If you're happy with the way you look though,
you may get less out of aggressive lines like, "C'mon, stick with 
it!", "You deserve this anguish!", "Doing this is the only way you'll ever earn
cake!"  Some of these examples might sound over-the-top, but teachers sometimes
stoke these thought patterns with sayings like, "I bet you all hate me so 
much for making you do these things!" or "####! It's just a ####ing 5-minute 
run!  This is why you'll never get anything you want."

Some perseverance is necessary for practice, but it's paradoxically 
limiting.  Some breakthroughs are impossible through determination and 
require a totally different approach.  For example, you can't will yourself to 
sleep if thoughts are racing.  No amount of sweating will make you gentler.  
Honest connection to other people doesn't come from sore muscles.

That's when a new sense of "practice" is needed.  It becomes more than 
just 60-90 minutes of pain in order to ease guilt about past or future 
transgressions. 
It instills the attitude necessary to progress onto greater things, after the 
well-defined abs and toned butt.  There is much said about "practicing yoga 
off the mat", but that idea doesn't need to be confined to yoga asana practice.
Running, lifting, dancing, and team sports all share the quality of providing
a greater life experience outside the room, if you let it.
Finding the higher purpose of practice can enlighten all aspects of life, but
the practitioner needs to allow it to unfold as a process.  No fighting is
necessary, just pure presence and joy.
